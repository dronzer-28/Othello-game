# Othello-game

## Othello Game Implementation

Description: Implemented the Othello game using Java, following the standard game rules and mechanics. Developed the game logic, including move validation, score calculation, and determining the winner. Utilized the Minimax algorithm with k-step look-ahead for AI player moves.

Technologies: Java, File I/O, Algorithms

Responsibilities:
Read and parse game state from a file
Implemented move validation and generation of valid moves
Developed the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for AI player moves
Calculated the game score based on the number of tiles for each player
Determined the winner at the end of the game
Created a user-friendly interface for playing the game

Accomplishments:
Successfully implemented the Othello game with efficient move generation and AI player using the Minimax algorithm
Improved programming skills in Java, file handling, and algorithmic problem-solving
